This is the CORRECT WAY to remove or disable the WordPress emojis feature that was added in v4.2.

== Description ==

Make your header clean, lean, and mean.

Emoji support is now so widespread that this feature should no longer belong to the WordPress core — and certainly not on every page of every WordPress site.

But I noticed that other plugins don't completely work, so that's [why I created this plugin](https://selftawt.com/disable-wpemoji-correctly/).

Simply activate this plugin to completely — and correctly — remove the built-in support for emojis that was added in WordPress v4.2.

**Features**

* Built using WordPress API and standards.
* Works out of the box with no configuration and setup.
* Compatible with the classic editor.
* Clean and lean code.

= What's different with this plugin compared to the others? =

TL;DR: Other plugins don't work correctly.
