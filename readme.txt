This is the RIGHT WAY to remove or disable WordPress emoji that was added in v4.2.

== Description ==

Make your header clean, lean, and mean.

Emoji support is now so widespread that this feature should no longer belong to WordPress — and certainly not on every page of every WordPress site.

Simply activate this plugin to completely — and correctly — remove the built-in support for emojis that was added in WordPress v4.2.

**Features**

* Built using WordPress API and standards.
* Works out of the box with no configuration and setup.
* Compatible with the classic editor.
* Clean and lean code.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's different with this compared to other plugins? =

I encourage (actually, highly recommend) you to browse the source code and see it for yourself.

= What's the goal? =

The goal is update the codebase of this plugin until (hopefully) WordPress removes the emoji feature from its core.
